summary: >
  Tables 2, 3, and 4, as well as Figures 4 and 5 from the manuscript, were successfully reproduced by following the instructions provided in the README file. Instructions were only available for reproducing these specific tables and figures. To avoid the lengthy execution time required to run the full experiments, the pre-computed results provided in the repository were used to generate the tables and figures, as recommended in the README.
